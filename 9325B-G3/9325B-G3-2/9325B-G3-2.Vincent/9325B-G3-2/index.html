            According to our interview with the baranggay captain, there are no reported issues regarding Gender Equality. Even so, we, the students of Saint Louis University at Baguio City, are advocating for gender equality for those in Brgy. 
            Magsaysay. We advocate because aside from this being our project in Web Systems and Technologies laboratory class, we want to help everyone, especially girls, women and those in the LGBT community, to defend themselves from those who 
            will mock and hurt them just because of their sex, gender and not living up to the societal expectations according to their sex. We also want to help the boys and men to not give up on the pressures some people has put on them in order
            to be called a "real man", not to be ridiculed for their so-called "weaknesses" just because they have emotions and are humans just like women too, and to make everyone to be aware of their problems that have been regarded as problems
            of the female population only. We are not going to stop those who wanted to conform to the traditional gender roles to be a girly girl or a manly man. In short, this advocacy's purpose is help everyone exert their rights as individual
            human beings who have their own individual differences, do not give in to the pressures of the society, strike the minds of the perpetrators of gender inequality with words, and inform everyone of their sex and gender-related issues that
            the media has often ignored. Discrimination has always been used as an excuse to enslave and hurt other people who are different from those discriminators.
